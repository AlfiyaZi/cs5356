Blockchain-based Lottery or Gambling
------------------------------------

### Background

Use the blockchain for a gambling and/or lottery system.

### Challenge

There are many sites that allow Bitcoin gambling, like Satoshibet, and making one (say for a different game of luck/skill) wouldn't be hard. But maybe we can use the public nature of the blockchain to determine winners (eg, pick winning lottery #s) in a transparently ungameable way?
