Blockchain Voting App
---------------------

### Background

Use the blockchain for the greater good, a private voting system.

### Challenge

An app that lets voters in an election (from a group of friends picking a movie, to a country) submit their votes, uniquely, privately, and verifiably, on a public blockchain - eg, Bitcoin's.  Then, eg, you could publicly prove the total vote count, without revealing any individual's vote.
