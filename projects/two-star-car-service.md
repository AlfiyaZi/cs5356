Two Star Car Service
--------------------

### Background

For the budget-conscious urban traveller there is actually a huge patch-work of car services available, at a lower level of service than well-known high-service offerings like Lyft or Uber.  These lesser-known services are difficult to access because you must know the service area, know the local phone number for the dispatcher, and you may need to speak a non-english language to communicate with the driver or the base.

### Challenge

Unite the city's car services through an app that allows drivers to indicate their availability, matches riders with drivers, allows for the input of destination, and the translation of instructions and communications from english to the language of the drivers choice.  Fare computation / algorithms not required and can be paid in cash. Charge drivers a small fee when they 'win' a fare (bases usually charge several dollars for this service).

### Further Ideas

Man with a van on demand, a constant problem with buying heavy items, such as furniture, off Craigslist.
