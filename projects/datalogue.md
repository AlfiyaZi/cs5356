Datalogue
---------

This project has already been started by a small group of folks who I worked with in Ithaca. We're very early in the development so anyone we'd love help if any of the challenges bellow can get you excited.

### Background

Create a market place for finding, linking and downloading data that scientists and researchers need to answer questions.

### Challenge

Design an SDK that can turn a database into an API. Design real time analytics dashboard for data sets currently in the system. Design a mechanism to securely exchange and link data without sharing identifiable information.  

### First User Story

Our user: A student or a researcher

Current Story:
  1. The user has a question she/he wants to answer and needs data. 
  2. The user goes online and googles around for where to find the data.
    1. This can sometimes be a very long process.
    2. Not to mention scrapping and cleaning the data before it is even useable.
  3. The user can repeate step 2 until their requirements are met then proceed to find their answer in the data. 

User story With datalogue:
  1. The user has a question. 
  2. The user logs onto datalogue to shop around for an appropriate dataset.
  3. The user can: 
    1. View properties of the dataset online and possibly answer their question on the spot.
    2. Or downloal the data
