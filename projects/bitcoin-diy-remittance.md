DIY Remittances App
-------------------

### Background

Use bitcoin as intermediate currency to make international payments, for the greater good.

### Challenge

The three steps involved are:

1. Sender uses local currency (eg USD) to buy some bitcoins
2. Sender sends bitcoins to recipient
3. Recipient sells bitcoins for local currency (eg MXN).

### Further Ideas

One of the oft-touted benefits of Bitcoin is payments aren't subject to the $0.30 minimum fee imposed by MasterCard etc, which could enable currently-infeasible things like paying $0.05 per article you read. ChangeTip is one promising company that offers an API for such payments: eg, on a comment board you can reply to a post with "great post! @ChangeTip, send $1" and ChangeTip will credit the post author with $1 (in Bitcoin).  This opens up a lot of further ideas for DIY remittance.
