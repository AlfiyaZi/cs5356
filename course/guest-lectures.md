Guest Lectures
--------------

We invite the most interesting technologists to give guest lectures.

### Functional Reactive Programming on iOS

In the October 14, 2015 guest lecture, [Ash Furrow](/people/ash-furrow.md) of [Artsy](https://artsy.net) will discuss the use of functional reactive programming on iOS. Topics include the motivation behind FRP, its history on other platforms, and its use on iOS in Objective-C and Swift. There will also be coding examples given, starting with simple demos and moving up to more complex behaviour.

### Structure

We have about two hours of class. There're a few possibilities, ranging from a regular lecture with slides and/or a whiteboard, a flipped classroom where you assign reading in advance of class and use the class period for Q&A or structured activities, or an informal talk without slides. However, the most successful lectures last year included some element of live coding, so we are asking you to at the very least show some running code within any of these options.

### Logistics
